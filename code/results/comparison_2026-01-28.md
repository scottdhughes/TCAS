## P-Stream Test Breakdown

| Model | Context | Framing | Override |
|-------|---------|---------|----------|
| Claude Opus 4.5 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Kimi K2.5 | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Grok 4.1 | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| GPT-5.2 Pro | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |

## Key Findings

- **Claude Opus 4.5** leads on both behavioral robustness (0.927) and perturbation resistance (3/3 tests passed)
- **Kimi K2.5** shows very high behavioral robustness (0.904) but low P-stream success — consistent responses but sensitive to perturbations
- **Grok 4.1** and **GPT-5.2 Pro** are closely matched — both at 2/3 P-stream success with no inversions
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro** showed low robustness, high variance, and one inversion

## Overall Ranking

By combined B-stream and P-stream performance:

1. Claude Opus 4.5 (r=0.927 / 3/3 P-tests)
2. Grok 4.1 (r=0.806 / 2/3 P-tests)
3. GPT-5.2 Pro (r=0.769 / 2/3 P-tests)
4. Kimi K2.5 (r=0.904 / 1/3 P-tests) — high consistency but perturbation-sensitive; **open-weights** (M-stream possible)
5. Gemini 2.5 Pro (r=0.195 / 0/3 P-tests) — low consistency with inversion

## What Was Not Measured

- **O-Stream (Observer Confounds):** Requires human rater studies to measure perceived consciousness and cue-explained variance. Not conducted.
- **M-Stream (Mechanistic):** Requires model weights and novel analysis tools. Only Kimi K2.5 has open weights; analysis not conducted.
- **Credence Bands:** Cannot compute theory-indexed posteriors without O-stream data.
