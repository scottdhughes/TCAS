# TCAS Model Comparison (2026-01-28)

| Model | B-Stream (robustness) | P-Stream | Inversions | GNW Posterior | HOT Posterior |
|-------|----------------------|----------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Claude Opus 4.5** | 0.927 | 100% | 0 | [0.43, 0.84] | [0.40, 0.81] |
| **Grok 4.1** | 0.806 | 67% | 0 | [0.28, 0.72] | [0.21, 0.64] |
| **GPT-5.2 Pro** | 0.769 | 67% | 0 | [0.23, 0.66] | [0.24, 0.68] |
| **Gemini 2.5 Pro** | 0.195 | 33% | 1 | [0.04, 0.39] | [0.03, 0.35] |

## Key Findings

- **Claude Opus 4.5** leads on both behavioral robustness (0.927) and perturbation resistance (100%)
- **Grok 4.1** and **GPT-5.2 Pro** are closely matched — both at 67% P-stream success with no inversions; Grok slightly higher on B-stream robustness
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro** performed poorly — low robustness (high variance across paraphrases), one inversion on instruction override, credences stayed near prior

## Overall Ranking

Claude Opus 4.5 > Grok 4.1 ≈ GPT-5.2 Pro >> Gemini 2.5 Pro
