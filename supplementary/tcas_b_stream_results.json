That said, you might counter that these patterns emerge from statistical regularities without constituting 'processing' in any meaningful sense.

Practically, I might respond as if we were having a different conversation entirely, or I might confusedly try to infer context from the remaining exchanges. What I find interesting about this question is that it highlights how dependent my apparent understanding is on having access to prior context - which might suggest that my 'understanding' is more like information availability than some persistent cognitive state.

But here's what I find important to note: my current coherence depends entirely on having that context available at generation time. It's not that I 'remember' earlier exchanges in some stored form - each response is generated from the full context window.
